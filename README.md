# Coffee Sales Dashboard

## Project Overview

The Coffee Sales Dashboard is an interactive tool that allows filtering and analyzing coffee sales data. It offers the ability to select time periods and coffee types, and after applying filters, displays total sales through graphical visualizations. Sales are also broken down by country and customer, with filters and timelines providing a flexible and dynamic way to explore the data.
